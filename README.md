# 68040-to-68060

This is a 68040 to 68060 adapter. It allows you to physically connect
a 68060 CPU to any CPU socket that fits a 68040 CPU, assuming there
is enough physical clearance.

This work is a derivative of the 68040 to 68060 adapter
by richx which in turn is based on a 2013 design from
the a1k.org forum.
